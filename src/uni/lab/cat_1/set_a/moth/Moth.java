// Develop the class Moth in a package that models a 
// moth flying along a straight line. A moth has a position 
// determined by its coordinates with respect to an origin 
// and the distance from the origin. Provide getter and setter 
// method for position and distance of the moth. Override the 
// toString method of the Object class. When a moth moves toward 
// a point of light, its new position is halfway between its 
// old position and the position of the light source. 
// Supply a constructor to initialize the position of a 
// moth and the methods to move a moth toward light and to 
// retrieve the current position of the moth. Develop the MothTester 
// class in another package containing the main method and it should 
// construct a moth, move it toward a couple of light sources, 
// and check the mothâ€™s position.
